This solution package is intended to gather my wholesale knowledge and experience on interviews.
As the projects' topics suggest (that) the main focus is to solve algorithms in mostly arrays and commonly used data structure (i.e. lists, stack, binary trees, binary search trees) problems by taking advantage of C++ STL.

P.S. At first and foremost, reading the topics about data structures, algorithms from major CS books, again and again, is definitely helped to grasp fundamentals of Computer Science even though the overall progress can be rather slow and painstaking.
